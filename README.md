#Description 
The aim of this project is to create a peer to peer video conferencing software for  meetings between peers on the LAN. It should allow audio/video transmissions between multiple people at the same time.

#Tools used 
Swing is the primary Java GUI widget toolkit. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€” an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.

Java Media Framework is a Java library that enables audio, video and other time-based media to be added to Java applications and applets. This optional package, which can capture, play, stream, and trans-code multiple media formats, extends the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) and allows development of cross-platform multimedia applications.
